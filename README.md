# aws-lambda-fun
Fun &amp; interesting (Python) programs in AWS Lambda. It is a good interface to write programs for AWS. VSCode or other editors might be better to use with easier integrations & external packages but there are lots of stuff you can do better in Lambda like for making APIs & triggering services. But I am just a beginner in this so don't take my opinion on this. It has a lot of usage for the Free Tier with lots of program memory & time. Other service API requests in Lambda might cost more to use than the Lambda function itself. I did a lot of work in my other [AWS Rekognition GitHub](https://github.com/San1dh/aws-rekognition-face-detection). I want to explore more free & fun programs that I can run in Lambda :)

Made the language formatting in translate/ with the csv file in Replit using a Python program. I'm not sure how to run it in Lambda. Maybe zip it in VSCode or another IDE & upload it to the Lambda function. Got the languages from the AWS docs & made it into a csv file from a website.
